## Continuous and Discrete

There are many different types of datasets and ways to categorize them. However, one common approach for numeric data is to classify the dataset as either "continuous" or "discrete".

A dataset is "continuous" if the values can be any value within a defined range. For example, if we had a dataset where the values are times of day, then we could have values for 12 AM, 3 AM, and 5 AM. But, we could subdivide and measure down to the minute instead of the hour and have values such as 12:02 AM, 3:17 AM, and 5:09 AM. Since any time value from 12:00 AM to 11:59 PM is valid, and we can meaningfully subdivide the units, this is continuous.

You will often see continuous datasets graphed using line charts and scatter plots.

A dataset is "discrete" if the values can only be specific values with no room for value inbetween. More importantly, we cannot meaningfully subdivide the units. For example, lets say we created a dataset of number of workers in different restaurants. We could have numbers such as 22, 34, and 55. We cannot have any inbetween values and cannot subdivide these units. We could not have 22.7 employed people in restaurant. This dataset is discrete.

For charting discrete datasets, you will often use bar charts and radar charts.
