Hey there! My name is Frank Corso, and it is a pleasure to meet you. My tech career started a long time ago, back in high school with this:

![My Xbox game called "A Game of Hockey"]({static}/images/a-game-of-hockey-vasculus.jpg)

I created an Xbox 360 game called "A Game of Hockey" which was basically a clone of Pong but with 4 paddles. I released it in the Xbox Live Indie Games program that was relatively new at the time.

This game was full of bugs and I am surprised anyone bought it. But, they did and it made me realize that I could have a future creating software. I recently recreated this game and uploaded it to itch.io if you want to [play it yourself](https://chronosstudio.itch.io/a-game-of-hockey) to see how awful it was ðŸ˜….

Now, 13 years later, I have worked on a variety of different projects and businesses from many different industries. My current side project, [LiteSurveys](https://litesurveys.com/), is a survey tool people can use to add quick slide-in surveys to their website (you might have seen one or two on this site).

Over the years, I have developed a passion for data analysis, visualization, and machine learning. But, most of my other sites are focused on marketing, business, or WordPress related topics so I haven't had a place to share some of the cool data or Python projects I am working on. This is why this site was created.

I'll be occasionally writing articles about data analysis, data warehousing, data visualization, and Python so check back!
