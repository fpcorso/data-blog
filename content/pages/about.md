Hey there! I'm Frank Corso, and it is a pleasure to meet you. My journey in the tech realm commenced in 2009 when I dipped my toes into programming. My first software project was this humble Pong clone:

I created an Xbox 360 game called "A Game of Hockey" which was basically a clone of Pong but with 4 paddles. I released it in the Xbox Live Indie Games program that was relatively new at the time.

Looking back, that game was plagued with bugs, and I often wonder how anyone bought it. Yet, they did, and this little experiment ignited a passion within me for crafting software. I recently recreated this game and uploaded it to itch.io if you want to [play it yourself](https://chronosstudio.itch.io/a-game-of-hockey) to see how awful it was ðŸ˜….

Now, 13 years later, I have worked on a variety of different projects and businesses from many different industries. In my most recent role, I was the Head of Engineering at [Podchaser](https://podchaser.com) where I led a team of 12 engineers and data scientists.

I always have several side/hobby projects going. My current side project, [LiteSurveys](https://litesurveys.com/), is a survey tool people can use to add quick slide-in surveys to their website (you might have seen one or two on this site).

Over the years, I have developed a passion for data analysis, visualization, and machine learning which led me to start this blog. I'll be occasionally writing articles about data analysis, data engineering, data visualization, and Python so check back!
