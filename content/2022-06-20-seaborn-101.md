When working with data in Python, there are many times where you will need to analysis or visualize the data. For example, maybe you are quickly looking for outliers or are creating a few charts to be shared.

There are many libraries for creating graphs. The most common is matplotlib. However, that can be a lot lower-level than you need most of the time and has a steep learning curve.

This is where seaborn comes in. [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org) is a library built on top of matplotlib and makes the process of creating charts from data sets simple.
