Hey there! My name is Frank Corso and it is a pleasure to meet you. My career in tech started a long time again back in high school with this:

![My Xbox game called "A Game of Hockey"]({static}/images/a-game-of-hockey-vasculus.jpg)

I created an Xbox 360 game called "A Game of Hockey" which was basically a clone of Pong but with 4 paddles. I released it in the Xbox Live Indie Games program that was relatively new at the time.

This game was full of bugs and I am surprised anyone bought it. But, they did and it made me realize that I could have a future creating software.

Now, 13 years later, I have worked on a variety of different projects and businesses from many different industries. Over the years, I have developed a passion for data analysis and visualization.

But, most of my other sites are focused on marketing, business, or WordPress related topics so I haven't had a place to share some of the cool data or Python projects I am working on. This is why this site was created.

I'll be occasionally writing articles about data analysis, data warehousing, data visualization, and Python so check back!
