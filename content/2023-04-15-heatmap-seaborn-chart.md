Heatmaps are a great way to visualize frequency or ranges of a multi-dimensional dataset. For example, you could quickly show which features are used the most for users on different paid plans of a SAAS app. Or, you could show which fields of a GraphQL API are used the most between different customer personas. 

This is useful if you are looking for trends or outliers in your data set. This could be in your early analysis to see what you want to look deeper into or it could be when sharing findings with stakeholders or a broader audience.

In Python, we can use [the Seaborn library]((https://seaborn.pydata.org)) to easily generate heatmaps. If you are new to Seaborn, you can glance through [my "Creating Your First Chart Using Seaborn" article](https://frankcorso.dev/seaborn.html) to get a quick sense of how Seaborn works.
